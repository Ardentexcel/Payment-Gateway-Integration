        22% of the total population in India (around 270 crores) live in poverty. “What exactly is poverty?”, 
         Poverty means living in conditions of where a person doesn’t have basic needs like proper food, water or shelter.
        The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little...
        Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth... these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women empowerment. 
        Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.
        We need to steer clear of this poverty of ambition, where people want to drive fancy cars and wear nice clothes and live in nice apartments but don't want to work hard to accomplish these things. Everyone should try to realize their full potential.
        Our small help can nourish someones life,Lets help them ......
